      "[Music] joining me now is double line capitals Jeffrey gunlock he's with us exclusively as he always is once the FED share finishes Jeffrey welcome back for our final visit of the year I'm glad you're with us today yeah we made it all the way to December judge uh interesting times yeah that's for certain I mentioned what pisani and Leeman have called it what would you call today it was pretty doish I mean the word of the today is any last meeting the word was careful he said that multiple times last meeting Market likes that because it respected the fact the curves inverted and economy is slowing down but that any word didn't have to be inserted and it strongly suggests that the FED inserted that because they believe I think that they're done and not only are they done what a lot of people don't realize is the Fed has uh been been on hold for four of the last five meetings so it's it's a it's a trend and uh we talked last meeting November 1st that we had started a bond rally that day and what a rally it's turned into it's turned into quite a good six weeks with the 10year treasury yield down 100 basis points uh and the long Bond you know up in the double digits so he had a November to remember one of my clients said in a meeting I did with him yesterday with one of the best months ever for for the investment grade bond market up over 42% in the month of November alone that hasn't happened since the80s which is really something because last time it happened you were starting with yields up at 10% is and here you were starting with yields at 5ish so half the yield so you needed an even bigger basis point move in rates so uh I thought the most interesting thing in the press conference came near the end where if I heard it right I think J Powell said that he wants to cut rates before we get to two if I heard him right and uh because he's respecting the momentum that inflation uh can have just like I criticized him two years ago for going too slowly and uh inflation overshot by 500 basis points above where they thought it was going to 4% or so it peaked out in the CPI at 9 and now it's coming down just as fast and I heard a lot of people before uh the announcement were talking about you know you can you can takes 3mon pce you can take it look at core this and that uh one month data and everything there's ways to get to 2% sort of numbers and I'll just add one that I didn't hear today that's uh core CPI X shelter which is at 2% and the reason I bring that up is shelter is a a bad construct it's owner's equivalent rent and it lags and it appears to our research that that owner's equivalent rent is going to come down by at least 400 basis points over over the course of 2024 and since that's about 30% of CPI kind of there you go so our CPI model suggests that we're only going to get one more month of a three handle CPI year-over-year and that it's quite possible at this point that the headline CPI could be 2.4 in June and if that's the case I think the FED Cuts rates because I heard J Powell I think say that you know we can't wait until inflation's at two because he respects the momentum on the downside cuz he learned a little bit of a lesson about the momentum on the upside he said he said he said they're aware of the risks of waiting too long to to cut rates Jeffrey he mentioned on numerous occasions today um the possibility of cutting for the so-called right reasons if the economy is just normalizing you got from the Outlook today the so-called Dot Plot 80 points of cuts next year as I mentioned how Leeman characterized this the FED moving closer to to the market rather than the other way around would you agree with that do do you see cuts and several of them next year for the right reasons uh I don't really see them for the so-called right reason I think that's what's baked into the Dot Plot and a little bit less so but somewhat to the shape of the yield curve that they're just going to cut by 3/4 of a percentage point or so says the FED I mean I I think that's pretty unlikely I I I think that if they cut rates that much they'll have to cut them more than that so I believe that we're going to see the yield curve de inverting in the first part of next year I think we're still going to have bonds rallying uh we've broken down below the trend line on the 10-year treasury yield that goes back a couple of years and there's a lot of room below it I I I would guess that we will see the 10e treasury yield in the low 3es sometime next year and that would be consistent in my view only with the FED cutting more like I don't know 200 basis points or even more uh next year so I I think we're looking for recession next year we've been talking about this the market seems to be picking up on that and uh we're starting to see uh the good part of the pivot from the FED which is relaxation of financial conditions and that leads to for the first moment uh risk assets doing well and of course they've done very very well since the last fed meeting and I suspect it's going to not be Trend change before year end but I believe that uh I noticed the action of the stock market was interesting today because as the 10-year treasury got all the way down to 4.0% and it couldn't break through down to a three handle I noticed that the stock market started to lose momentum and then when it backed up on the 10e to where it is now just a few basis points but there's something about if you break below four on on the 10 year that I think it almost sounds like a fire alarm going off relative to the economy and I I I think we might start to see see the correlation of strong bonds and strong equities start to break down when it comes to uh fixed income strategy I outlined that I didn't like t- Bill and chill that's what we talked about last meeting I said there's nothing wrong with a 556 month Bill except the fact that you only get it for six months you wanted to be a little bit further out the curve say 3 to five years in credit and marry that with long-term treasuries and all of that has worked and I think that it's likely to continue to work in the new year which is really interesting because I think that all this money that's in Money Market funds and that might be overallocated to other assets than bonds and institutions I think the logic that people have that money market bloat is going to go into the stock market is wrong I think it's unlikely for investors to go from risk-free six-month T bills to the Magnificent s at at massive pees and all-time highs on the Dow Jones Industrials I think they're much more likely to go from their mountain of cash in t bills into bonds and so I I think that the strategies that I've outlined in the past couple of times we met which have been this mix of credit in the middle of the capital structure and long-term treasuries I think you stay with it for now i' I've been thinking about that movie Braveheart where they're about to attack and uh the Mel Gibson character is saying hold hold hold hold you know they want to fire do whatever their assault is but they have to wait for the right moment I think you have to wait for the right moment to alter this Bond strategy and that right moment will be when the recession comes I mean maybe maybe some of the money and money markets is split maybe some goes into bonds for the very reasons you suggest maybe some goes into stocks because they see the possibility of of a powerful new bull market developing I'm going to go to hang on just for a second Jeffrey Steve Leeman's just stepped out of the room and I I do want to go um to him uh because Steve this was extraordinary on on a number of of levels I think number one the FED share in his news conference did nothing to walk anything back from the statement he did nothing to Hawk it up so to speak and I know he sounded like it would be premature and he said as much premature to declare Victory there was no jumpsuit there was no aircraft carrier but he doesn't seem like he's that far away either from doing just that yeah I think this was a pretty big day Scott I think that U the FED pivoted today I think it went from having this bias to to being in neutral with a forecast to cut rates and I think that's a pretty big deal and he acknowledged in response to my question that yeah they sat around the table today and yesterday and they talked about Ray Cuts here's a quote from the uh from the press conference this the other question the question of when will it be become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint in place that that begins to come into view uh and is clearly a discuss topic of discuss discussion out in the world and and also a discussion for us uh at our meeting today Scott I I thought the chair might have tried to hold back the water on the damn one more meeting I guess the data yesterday um and today especially the PPI and what it says he mentioned this specifically we talked about it on your show at noon today what the data today says what's going to happen to the pce numbers next week made it kind of untenable for him to hold back and and to M maintain a h a position that was too hawkish and uh just real quick we have been talking about this uh uh number that uh Jeff was talking about this uh CPI ex shelter which has down been below 2% for several months now uh there there's that number right there and you can see it it's down below two and then okay so it's not fair to take shelter out the reason you take shelter out is because the shelter in in um component they use there is lagged about 3/4 Scott from some of the other market-based indicators that are out there and if you fold those in you really don't have a problem it may be that the FED is already there and and and the concern was that the FED would keep rates high and depress the economy for too long based on bad data Steve I appreciate it uh quite a day that I know we're going to be talking about many more times in the days ahead that's our senior economics reporter Steve lean just out of the news conference with the chair back to Jeffrey gunlock who's with us exclusively of course from double line so Jeffrey how come you're not willing to go as far as to say you know what I no longer think that we're going to have a recession I I'm I'm wrong at this point the economy is better than I I I ever thought it would be at this point inflation's come down much quicker than I ever thought it would be at this point and you know what maybe the fed's going to pull this off after all well I don't think uh inflation's come down faster than I expected to it's really followed the trajectory pretty pretty closely ly and it's going to continue to fall further um I just think that a lot of the way the market Works through Cycles it was I I thought as as so often the case Brian Kelly I think his name is is on that segment before the announce I know you're talking about you're talking about David Kelly and he was talking about a pivot that the that he saw that this was a pivot today yeah not just that though he points out that when you first start raising rates from low levels it doesn't have a real Market damage but then what similarly when you start cutting rates from high levels you start to affect the economy in a negative way somewhat counterintuitively because people uh might wait for lower interest rates if they think they're coming to do things that can accelerate the deterioration of the economy and also the FED themselves is uh projecting a 4.1 unemployment rate which would be up about 70 basis points from the low and whenever the historically the unemployment rate has gone up by over 50 basis points it tends to accelerate from there to a higher level goes into another gear and it's very consistent historically I think there's an I think there's a contradiction between the Dot Plot of the of unemployment rate going to 4.1 uh and and history so I think that the fed's going to be wrong on the low end for the unemployment rate for 2024 and I think that once you get the the market de inverting the yield curve and you start to really get the the bond rail cemented into the DNA of investor psychology I think that's usually the peak in Risk assets that's why I say it's okay now for the Braveheart idea of hold hold hold but you're going to have to Pivot and I think you have to Pivot in a very intense way um in both stocks and bonds when we get into the next recession maybe I'm wrong and it doesn't happen next year but I think the odds have gone up not down we saw G GDP now was about 5% or so in the in the third quarter and it's now running you know substantially less than that and talking about maybe 1% next year and I just don't think that's the way the economy works just like inflation overshoots on the upside it overshoots on the downside I think that the economy is going to undershoot on the downside and the employ unemployment rates going to go up and that is going to uh create a totally different response we're going to have to gon to have to have a lot of money printing I think to battle the coming recession and that's why you might have to Pivot across the board because the uh inflationary consequences of that could be very substantial so this is a Long View type of thing but but for now uh you know I think the the fed's pivot needs to be digested by the markets and obviously a lot of that digestion happened today uh and uh we'll we'll see how the rest of the week plays out because that pretty much takes us to till the end of the year I want to sort of get your overall assessment of this fed because I remember so many of the conversations that we've had through this calendar year ones where you've suggested that you know pal was Mr Meo um going to drive into a wall other time suggesting he was up on this ladder and it's time to like paint or get off the ladder um yeah that was at the beginning yeah and here he is with this what I felt today was a a bit of a a confident air about him in the way that he described this battle that they've waged over the last 12 months and feels like they're in a in a pretty good space how would you assess that well the I I I think he does feel that way and it may be transitory might he might just be in that goldilock sweet spot of that but the Mr Meo thing was about how the FED historically just keeps raising and raising something falls apart and he hasn't done that as I said at at the open we've had four pauses in the last 5 minutes minutes five meetings rather that's that's a lot different than Mr mooing it and just bumping into dumpsters and stuff he he seems to have gotten in sync with the leads and lags a little bit better I think he's learned something over the past three years thankfully and so we're at that at that point where he has repeated as Steve lean said you know he he realizes that not all the tightening has gone through the system so that's anything but Hawking it up I mean that that's him saying you know some of the tit is still yet to be yet to be felt and that's going to be the case as long as we're higher for longer as long as the FED funds rate stays where it is you're having problems in the system you have you have a lot of loans you know you've got uh banks that have uh investment portfolios yielding 3% and the FED funds rates at 5 and 38 so they're losing money on that you've got uh small companies that are having elevated borrowing costs and every single day it becomes more painful and every month they have debt at lower interest rates that is is uh rolling off uh the fixed rate debt that was may be issued few years ago 1% that's rolling off and that's higher and so this is working its way through the system he understands that and so I compliment him on that he's learned and I think the way I I I the only thing I had canault the FED for in the past five meetings is that they shouldn't have hiked at all they should have kept stayed on pause the whole time but that's pretty close and one more thing I want to say about economic indicators is the commodity price trend which has been straight down uh in a Non-Stop way on a moving average basis uh for for the better part of two years and the Bloomberg commodity index just can't get above its 200 day moving average and stay there in fact the Gap is getting wider and so uh it's interesting that you know Gold's up today not surprisingly with interest rates down but Commodities broadly on the bcom are unchanged so the stubborn weakness in the blueberg commodity index is further suggested to me that inflation is going to be lower than people think and I'm I'm wondering if we won't have a zero year-over-year inflation at some point in in 2024 I've you know I understand why you make the the bullish case you do for for bonds which have as you said had a historic rally November was the best month for treasury since the 80s for obvious reasons we've dropped near hundred a 100 basis points on the 10year for example but why shouldn't people buy stocks today why shouldn't they say if you want to buy because they're because they're up massively since the last fed meeting and they're uh they're in pretty rarified territory and the economy is going to be slowing and earnings are going to be uh less robust than people think but if you want to own stocks and of course everybody owns some I think that one Trend that has been very clear throughout 2023 for good reasons is that equal weighted stocks like lower interest rates and uh they they don't like higher interest rates the Magnificent 7 don't care really they're in a world of their own but we've had a lot of talk about equal weighted versus market cap weighted and we've seen equal weighted do quite well since the last fed meeting and there's a reason for that the the FED hikes hurt the equal weighted more than the market cap weighted because it's the smaller companies that get taken out by higher interest rates and so I I think you want equal weighted uh rather than market cap weighted at this juncture and so I don't think there's a terrible valuation in the equal weighted Market but the weighted Market it's maybe 15 times in in the equal weight but almost sounds like it's a little too high it's someone could take what you're saying though but someone could take what you're saying Jeffrey is making the case for an everything rally that the equal weight part of the market the you know S&P 473 for lack of a or 493 for lack of a better description obviously um is going to get a boost now if the FED truly is done hiking and the next moves multiple of of which are are are cuts the economy is still hanging in there why why not well I I just think that the everything rally concept is a is a is a realization of what's happened in the past six weeks and we kind of expected that because we now have the full-fed pivot it sounded pivot is but it was more balanced back in November 1st but now we have a full-fed pivot with the word any showing up and Powell talking about lags and all that stuff so I I just I just think that we're getting late in the cycle and you can hang on there with risk assets and I'm I'm not exactly advocating against it particularly in the higher uh credit sectors but not not not investment grade but the maybe Double B sectors of of parts of the bond market but even there I think you will have a a reversal come the middle of the year so we can hang in there for now but I think stocks are pretty overvalued versus uh where they were uh say uh I don't know six weeks ago or certainly back in in March it is a stunner um lastly Before I Let You Go that you know as far as yields have have come down you mentioned you know you'll have uh low threes by the you know the end of next year sometime we could have high threes by the time I say goodbye to you um here today which is remarkable considering we were at 5% not that long ago yeah oh uh October 23rd in fact the the New York Times had had a business section article that I saved because it said rates are not going to come down anytime soon as the cover of the business section I said said they're ringing the bell but there's an old say I'll leave you with an old saying that old timers like me used to cut our teeth on and that is stocks need bonds but bonds don't need stocks and right now stocks are needing bonds and they're getting it but we'll get into that phase I think in the second quarter or so of next year where bonds don't need stocks but stocks won't be participating the way bonds will so that's that's how I think about the pivot but I also think think it's going to be a year for of of great volatility uh in 2024 well we'll look forward to spending it with you I can say one of the true highlights of this year Jeffrey was spending every fed day with you exclusively here on closing bell I look forward to doing the very same thing next year you have a good one stay healthy happy New Year we'll see you yeah good luck everybody and uh good luck in the New Year all right that's Jeffrey gunlock once again exclusively from double line with us right here on closing bell\n",

    "- Jeffrey Gundlach suggests the Federal Reserve (Fed) is likely done raising interest rates, as indicated by the use of the word \"any\" in their recent meeting, hinting at a dovish stance.\n",
    "- The Fed has paused interest rate hikes in four of the last five meetings, signaling a trend of holding rates steady.\n",
    "- A bond rally began on November 1st, with significant yield decreases over the past six weeks, including a 100 basis point drop in the 10-year Treasury yield.\n",
    "- November experienced one of the best months ever for the investment-grade bond market, with returns over 4.2%, a level not seen since the 1980s.\n",
    "- Gundlach believes the Fed may cut rates before inflation hits the 2% target, respecting the momentum of inflation's rise and fall.\n",
    "- Core CPI excluding shelter is already at 2%, and shelter costs are expected to decrease significantly in 2024, potentially leading to further reductions in the CPI.\n",
    "- The Fed's Dot Plot indicates an 80 basis point rate cut next year, suggesting a move closer to market expectations.\n",
    "- Gundlach anticipates a recession in the next year, with a potential de-inversion of the yield curve in early 2024 and further bond rallies.\n",
    "- He advises a continued investment strategy combining credit in the middle of the capital structure with long-term treasuries.\n",
    "- Gundlach predicts that money currently in money market funds will likely move into bonds rather than equities, given the lower risk profile.\n",
    "- He cautions that the correlation between strong bonds and strong equities may break down if the 10-year Treasury yield falls below 4%.\n",
    "- The Fed's projection of an unemployment rate increase to 4.1% could signal a deeper economic downturn, as historically a rise in unemployment tends to accelerate.\n",
    "- Commodity price trends, particularly the Bloomberg Commodity Index's inability to stay above its 200-day moving average, suggest further disinflation ahead.\n",
    "- Gundlach warns of potential inflationary consequences from monetary responses to the next recession, implying a need for a strategic pivot in both stocks and bonds.\n",
    "- He remains skeptical of the stock market's value, noting that equal-weighted stocks prefer lower interest rates, while large-cap stocks (the \"Magnificent 7\") operate independently of these concerns.\n",
    "- The Fed's recent pivot is now fully realized, with Chair Powell acknowledging the lag in policy effects, leading to a more balanced approach to rate hikes.\n",
    "- Gundlach concludes with an old market adage, \"stocks need bonds, but bonds don't need stocks,\" suggesting that bonds may continue to outperform stocks into the next year.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Jeffrey Gundlach认为，美联储(Fed)可能已经停止加息，这一观点源自他对美联储最近会议中使用了\"any\"一词的解读，暗示了鸽派立场。\n",
    "- 在过去五次会议中，美联储已经有四次暂停了加息，这表明了维持利率稳定的趋势。\n",
    "- 从11月1日开始，债券市场出现了一波涨势，过去六周内收益率大幅下降，其中10年期国债收益率下降了100个基点。\n",
    "- 11月份对于投资级债券市场来说是有史以来表现最好的一个月，回报率超过4.2%，这一水平是自上世纪80年代以来从未见过的。\n",
    "- Gundlach认为，在通胀达到2%的目标之前，美联储可能会降息，以尊重通胀上升和下降的动力。\n",
    "- 不包括住房的核心CPI已经达到2%，预计2024年住房成本将大幅下降，这可能导致CPI进一步降低。\n",
    "- 美联储的点阵图表明，明年可能会有80个基点的降息，这表明了与市场预期更接近的走势。\n",
    "- Gundlach预计明年将会出现经济衰退，可能在2024年初出现债券收益率曲线的非倒挂和进一步的债券涨势。\n",
    "- 他建议继续采取投资策略，将信贷与长期国债结合在资本结构的中间部分。\n",
    "- Gundlach预测，目前存放在货币市场基金中的资金可能会流入债券市场而不是股票市场，鉴于较低的风险配置。\n",
    "- 他警告称，如果10年期国债收益率跌破4%，强势债券和强势股市之间的相关性可能会破裂。\n",
    "- 美联储对失业率上升至4.1%的预测可能预示着更深层次的经济衰退，因为从历史上看，失业率上升往往会加速经济下行。\n",
    "- 商品价格趋势，特别是彭博商品指数无法保持在其200日移动平均线之上，表明未来可能会出现进一步通货紧缩。\n",
    "- Gundlach警告称，对下一次经济衰退的货币政策反应可能会带来通货膨胀的后果，这意味着股票和债券市场都需要战略性的转变。\n",
    "- 他对股票市场的价值持怀疑态度，指出等权重股更倾向于较低的利率，而大盘股（\"Magnificent 7\"）则独立于这些担忧。\n",
    "- 美联储最近的转变已经完全实现，鲍威尔主席承认政策效果的滞后性，从而导致更加平衡的加息态度。\n",
    "- Gundlach最后引用了一句老话，\"股票需要债券，但债券不需要股票\"，这表明债券可能会持续在明年表现优于股票。\n",
