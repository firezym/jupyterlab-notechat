      "[Music] so two weeks ago I had the honor of participating in the double line Roundtable Prime as a panelist where we discussed and debated the the fate of the economy markets uh just a whole array of things why the experts of course keep getting it wrong in the intersection of Federal Reserve policy during a presidential election year now of course we know a lot has changed in the economy and markets post 2020 and now many are wondering if we're actually in a new paradigm shift or maybe just old patterns have been altered under circumstances like uh the pandemic the Avalanche of money into this economy and a Federal Reserve that seems to be trying to rewrite its own Playbook now remember double line is uh is just an amazing firm founded in 2009 by Jeffrey gunlock also of course known as the bond King on Wall Street because of his frustration with the industry at the time currently managing $93 billion under management I would like to bring in now founders CEO Jeffrey gunlock Jeff thank you so much for coming on and again I want to thank you for inviting me to that round table I absolutely loved it uh I learn more I learn so much every time I go and I appreciate it I want to begin with you and the audience with a big with the big picture Wall Street has bought a hook line and sinker into the notion of a soft Landing for the economy it's reflected in the stock market to the and the bond market your thoughts well first of all Charles thanks for doing the round table Prime which is up on double line.com I mean you just absolutely crushed it I thought that was terrific um what what's going on here is ever since November 1st with the FED getting very very dubish uh unequivocally in the press conference and in the in the statements we've seen a very strong rally in just about everything um and that's caused by about a 100 basis point rally in bonds we had real interest rates Rising relentlessly for much of last year and that reversed when the fed did that pivot so rates are down a lot but one thing that I think I can help the the audience with is for a while it was all blue chip assets that were going up in November and December it was treasury bonds it was S&P 500 but if you looked underneath the surface in the fixed income Market what you saw was that the middle part of the market was not participating what I mean by that is not AAA Securities not treasuries I'm talking about double a single a triple B types of Securities particularly those that are securitized so say commercial real estate back Securities asset back Securities tied to the consumer there was still a lot of skepticism about that part of the market and a lot of investors don't pay attention to that it really is a very important thing to watch and that those sectors have absolutely uh Shrugged off all of the fears that were holding them back say in November and December and are now really almost priced for Perfection uh let me talk about the commercial real estate Securities Market we had a big meeting about that uh yesterday and we're talking about how the fundamentals since November in the commercial particularly the office Market but commercial real estate market have not improved if you look at it very carefully they've actually gotten modestly worse and yet the Securities have gone up massively in price uh treasury yields are up a little bit this year 25 basis points but the yields on say doublea commercial Mortage back Securities have have gone down by 150 basis points we bought some Securities around the time of Roundtable Prime that were single a rated in the in that market and they're up about six points in the last couple of weeks which is a huge catchup what I'm getting to here Charles is there seems to be a grabby nature to the market which advises caution no matter what you think about the so-called soft Landing in in the economy um so we think this is time to be upgrading portfolios uh and selling some of these assets because there's liquidity now that didn't exist for much of 2023 and so in a broad sense because this is kind of a pyun thing that I'm talking about in a broad sense I think the markets are in a Euphoria type of a period right now and I worry about that no no I was going to say to that point I did a a segment a couple of weeks ago I got cute tried to get cute about the canary and a CO Min and does the canary ever get can the canary actually you know uh be too exuberant and it sounds like yeah you know if we can't depend on the bond market to to be a keep a steady hand that maybe there is too much exuberance out there but you know one of the reasons I think for that Jeff is uh think about the yield curve inversion right it's been a long time uh there've been some other things like leading economic indicators it's been a long time since they've been negative and the promise was that those were reliable uh indicators proxies for impending recessions so the longer have that we don't have a recession more the more confident everyone gets that we're not going to have one and then it feels like you know you know Katie bar a door because the last person in is going to miss out yes well the yield curve has been inverted now uh for about 80 weeks maybe a little more than 80 weeks which is I'm talking about two to tens and you can look at almost all comparisons they've been inverted for about that time period the only uh uh episode that had a longer period of inverted yield curve before the recession came was in the late 70s early 80s which interestingly was also the last time we had an inflation fight going on although that one was uh much more difficult than this one appears to be so I I I think though that the thing on the yield curve that's important is the twoos 10 was negative 108 basis points the 10e yield was lower than the 2-year yield by 108 basis points and now it's 18 and when you start to De invert you really get to be on recession watch and the fact that recession hasn't come after 80 plus weeks of f Cur inversion is a very bad logic to say it's not coming because the D inversion is happening when it comes to Leading economic indicators they've fallen for 21 consecutive months but the thing that's wrong about uh historical comparisons or misleading perhaps about historical comparisons is this economy has been very strange in that manufacturing was very strong in 2021 2022 with all that stimulus that came in and it went to a lot of uh durable goods you know uh type of pro products and the leading economic indicators are skewed towards manufacturing so it's not surprising that they've been weak for a long time because they're very manufacturing oriented and Manufacturing is very weak but the economy handed off the GDP if you will to the services sector sector starting about 18 months ago and and that uh has skewed a lot of these economic indicators so the leading economic indicators have been very negative for a long time the yield curve has been inverted for a long time but the thing that I'm most concerned about now economically is reports coming from the states we look at national unemployment data and we you I saw heard in the previous segment talking about that I thought it was a good conversation but the states release unemployment data too and amazingly 88% of the states I think they have DC in there so there's 51 of them 88% of them are reporting Rising unemployment over the last 6 months and I'm having a very hard time squaring this circle if 88% of the states are reporting Rising unemployment how can it be that national unemployment remains stable at a very very low level right um I guess the only logic would be that the other 12% of the states are making up for all of that Rising unemployment which is kind of hard to believe because those States while it includes Texas and I think includes Pennsylvania it also includes North Dakota and Wyoming it's hard for me to believe that this set of states can offset Rising unemployment in Florida Illinois uh California New York and so I'm I'm skeptical about this data um and and so I I I noticed that in the jolts survey that job openings thing that was getting a lot of play because it was so elevated uh the percentage of of surveyor responding to the survey uh used to be 75% and now it's down I'm talking about maybe 5 years ago and now it's down to 35% so what is going on here that suddenly 35% responding I I wonder if the survey data is really comparable to past periods there's no doubt I don't know I I go ahead no I was just going to say there there's no doubt that we should there's there's a lot less reli they feel a lot less reliable by the way I was going to say also with the states the so-call Som rule uh the speed of which some of these states are losing jobs or the unemployment rate 20 are technically in recession already Jeffrey if you can I want you to stick around we got to take a quick break when we come back uh you know I want to I want to talk about the we talked about the dangerous spots but also want to talk about investment opportunities where investors should be thinking about moving we'll be right back with the bond [Music] King all right folks welcome back and remember carve out some time you really do want to watch this double line Round Tree uh and you go to doubl line.com it is really worth it it is a it's just a magnificent event and and trust me anyone serious about investing in this market uh you should take out the time meanwhile Jeff jeffre gunlock is back with us and you know Jeff I want to start with J pal um because let's face it that octo that late October pivot you you alluded to it uh the sort of we're going to do three rate Cuts in instead of two call it a Victory lap How concerned are you though that maybe he's becoming like Captain Ahab chasing this soft Landing I think what J Powell is doing is he realizes a couple of things first of all real rates are pretty high if you look at the inflation rate which people have chosen to start parsing things like three and six months annualized and excluding things uh from various indices but nonetheless the inflation rate is clearly falling and it's going to fall further We Believe absence something like an oil shock and so I think J Powell is thinking about not so much a soft Landing but that he needs rates to come down on a real basis because the inflation ratees coming down also we have this problem with interest expense we have now about a trillion dollars per year of interest expense which is about 15% of GDP and it's headed higher if rates stay where they are the average treasury yield rate is about 3.2 and there are no three handles out there in the bond market market so every bond that matures is going to have uh is likely to push that higher all of the uh 5-year treasuries that were issued in 2019 or coming due this year those had yields of like 50 basis points and they're going to be refinanced reissued at yields as of today above 4% this would put the push the interest expense much higher and this is a really fundamental problem we need to get our interest expense down and if the inflation rate is relaxing there that that's a good way to do it so that that's how I'm thinking about things Rel to J Powell I do expect they're going to cut rates I'm not really of strongly of the opinion as most people are that's all political I think there's it it lurks in the background you know the fact that it's a presidential election year but I really think it's about about where the economy is which is in a stable place for now but where the real interest rates are so I think investors should buy two three fiveyear treasuries because you're locking in a a rate which isn't uh you know top powering but it's above the inflation rate which continues to fall and I think those rates on the shortest end the old T Bill and chill strategy which I never really recommended because I think the fed's going to cut so if you want to buy a five and a quarter a six-month Bill you'll be happy for six months but there's a strong chance you might roll that over at a level that's below today's uh three and fiveyear treasuries so that that's what I kind of like in fixed income I'm I'm less fond in the prior segment I talked about these big rallies in uh junk bonds and even lower uh tier investment grade bonds which really seem extended I prefer treasury bonds there now when it comes to the equity Market we talked about the round table I like Japan I like uh India and I like these as long-term plays we're in a valuation spot in the equity Market where I think you start have to start looking long-term and sort of try to skip this last phase of the uh exuberation uh exuberance game because I think the value is very very high and it bothers me that the leader the Magnificent 7 has really stopped being a leader in the upside it's it's participating but it peaked out on a relative strength basis back in July and so I'm suspicious of the valuations and I'm suspicious of the exuberance in the market so I want to have cash at this point which I want to deploy maybe even 25% cash which I might want to deploy in in in the aftermath of the recession that is going to come yes it's been delayed yes the M2 economists that are geared towards money supply have been uh particularly wrong because M2 in spite of the fact that's negative year-over-year which is often historically a recession recession sign it's still at a very high level and I've looked at the trend line of M2 prior pandemic and to where we are today we're still above the M2 growth trend line that was in place pre pandemic and it might stay in place that way for another year or so but I think look you investors should be looking longterm and looking to hold cash and by Emerging Markets which are doing very badly and will continue to do badly as we enter recession so stay away for now but buy them once they're substantially cheaper you'll notice that China is doing very badly and that's bleeding over into Emerging Markets broadly we've got Emerging Markets particularly India Japan maybe China uh hold on to cash and and t- Bill and chill something that you normally don't do but in this environment I love the fact that you're getting people prepared for what may be down the road instead of being so myopic because this market and believe me it's the experts more than anyone else have become so fixated on chasing performance I think it's going to hurt them and a whole lot of people Jeff it has been an absolute honor thank you very much we really appreciate it thank you well thank you Charles good luck with 2024 you too [Music] buddy\n",

    "- Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, participated in a roundtable discussing the economy and markets, emphasizing the uncertainty and the need for caution given the current financial environment.\n",
    "- DoubleLine Capital, founded in 2009 by Gundlach, manages $93 billion, earning him the title \"Bond King\" for his expertise in the bond market.\n",
    "- The economy has seen significant changes post-2020, raising questions about whether we are experiencing a new paradigm shift or merely altered old patterns due to the pandemic, massive monetary injections, and a proactive Federal Reserve.\n",
    "- Gundlach critiques the widespread belief in a soft landing for the economy, highlighted by strong market rallies since the Federal Reserve's dovish pivot on November 1, leading to a 100 basis point rally in bonds and a decrease in real interest rates.\n",
    "- He points out the discrepancy in market performance between blue-chip assets and middle-market securities, such as commercial real estate and asset-backed securities, indicating a market driven by euphoria and advising portfolio upgrades in response.\n",
    "- Gundlach expresses concern over the commercial real estate market, noting that despite worsening fundamentals, securities prices have surged, suggesting an overly optimistic market pricing for perfection.\n",
    "- The conversation shifts to the yield curve inversion, which has been present for over 80 weeks, historically a precursor to recessions. Gundlach warns against dismissing recession risks simply because one has not occurred yet, especially as the yield curve begins to de-invert.\n",
    "- Leading economic indicators have been negative for 21 months, skewed by a strong manufacturing sector in 2021-2022, which has since shifted towards a service-oriented GDP, complicating economic forecasts.\n",
    "- Gundlach raises skepticism about national unemployment data, contrasting it with state-level reports showing rising unemployment in 88% of states, questioning the reliability of national figures.\n",
    "- On monetary policy, Gundlach expects rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, driven not by political motives but by the need to adjust for falling inflation and the unsustainable interest expense burden, which has reached about 15% of GDP.\n",
    "- Investment recommendations include buying two to five-year treasuries, anticipating rate cuts, and being cautious about the current rally in junk bonds and lower-tier investment-grade bonds, advocating for treasury bonds instead.\n",
    "- For the equity market, Gundlach likes long-term investments in Japan and India, advising against chasing the current phase of market exuberance and maintaining a significant cash position for future investment opportunities, especially in emerging markets once they become cheaper.\n",
    "- The discussion concludes with a caution against the myopic chase for performance in the market, emphasizing the importance of preparing for potential downturns and looking at long-term investment strategies.\n",
